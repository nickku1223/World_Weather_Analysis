# Purpost of the project
The purpost of this project is to be able to request and use APIs to retreive data from the websites, which in this case,  OpenWeatherMap and Google, using Python and the data retreived from the websites to help customers to explore travel destinations based on the their preferred weather conditions.

We also help find possible Hotels for different destinations for the customers to plan the trip. And with the Google Map and Direction API, we can show the customers the possible travel route and time.
